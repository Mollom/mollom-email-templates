  Hello $sub_name, <br><br>
  Welcome!  This month's Mollom update contains the latest stats and information about how Mollom 
  is protecting your sites and safeguarding your business. Over the last month, 
  <font color='green'><b>Mollom</b></font> protected $site_count sites for you.

  Here are this month's key stats across all sites that Mollom is protecting for you:
  <ul>

        Of all posts checked, <b> $spam_percent % </b> were identified as spam.

    <li> Mollom saved you <b> $moderation_time </b> of manual moderation work.* </li>
    <li> <b> $legit_posts </b> legitimate posts were made by users of your site 
        who didn't have to solve a CAPTCHA thanks to Mollom's Artificial Intelligence.
    </li>
  </ul>

  You could be saving even more time by using Mollom's <b> Content Moderation Platform (CMP)? </b>   
  The CMP collects all of the posts needing moderation in one, convenient dashboard (no matter which site they were posted on!) 
  so you can quickly approve or flag them as spam and move on to other things. It's included as part of your
  Mollom subscription, and hey, who doesn't want some extra time back in their day! Check out all the time-saving tools 
  in the CMP at my.mollom.com.
