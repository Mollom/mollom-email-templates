About the templates
======================

This is the Template Folder for Mollom emails. Edit/create the templates for Mollom Emails here.
The PHP scripts which send out emails will use these templates to send the emails.
The template files would generally have the file extension '.tpl' as  a hint that the file a template file. But it could be anything. 

To send emails :
================
Create a JIRA ticket specifying the url of the template, a brief text describing the purpose of the email (optional) and the intended recipients (eg. Mollom free subscribers or Mollom paid subscribers) of the email. 
Asign the ticket to one of the developers in Mollom.
